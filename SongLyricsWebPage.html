            One thing I don't know why
            It doesn't even matter how hard you try
            Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
            To explain in due time

            All I know
            Time is a valuable thing
            Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
            Watch it count down to the end of the day
            The clock ticks life away

            It's so unreal
            Didn't look out below
            Watch the time go right out the window
            Tryin' to hold on, did-didn't even know
            I wasted it all just to watch you go

            I kept everything inside and even though I tried
            It all fell apart
            What it meant to me will eventually
            Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
            
            I tried so hard and got so far
            But in the end it doesn't even matter
            I had to fall to lose it all
            But in the end it doesn't even matter
